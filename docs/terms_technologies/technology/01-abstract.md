# Abstract

Since 2008, Blockchain technology has continually evolved, becoming more versatile to use and cost effective. Today, however, despite all the diversity found within the Blockchain space, most business problems remain unsolved or at best partially solved. Examples of such problems in modern organizations include:

- Network bandwidth (transaction rate);
- Network and data security;
- Scalability;
- Latency time;
- User experience;
- Flexible economy;
- Versatility and the ability to customize a Blockchain for different conditions and user requests.

There are projects achieving significant results in solving these problems, but other no less important problems remain unresolved because of it.
We believe that Blockchain must simultaneously solve all the problems listed above in order to become a mass working tool for companies and organizations.
The Power team has a goal to achieve it.
