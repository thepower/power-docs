# Preparing the project

First, you need to prepare your project. To do this, follow the steps:

1. Create `dcloud_example` directory.
2. Open the console (terminal) and make the path to `dcloud_example` folder as a home directory.
3. Clone the `tssdkExamples` repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:thepower/tssdkExamples.git
   ```

   :::info

   This repository contains all the files you'll need to work with in the next sections.

   :::

4. Add `tssdk` library to the project by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install @thepowereco/tssdk
   ```

Now you can work with [transactions](./working-with-accounts/01-register-an-account.md) and [smart contracts](../smart-contracts/01-intro.md).
