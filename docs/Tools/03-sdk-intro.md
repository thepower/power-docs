# Power SDK

The Power SDK is the SDK for developing decentralized applications of the Power DCloud platform.

## Features

1. Power SDK interacts with the blockchain without intermediaries and without the need to run a node:

    - developer doesn't need to write a backend API for user-blockchain interactions.
    - user directly connects to the blockchain via the developer-connected SDK, which works directly as a part of a dApp.

2. Power SDK directly receives data from the contract storage and sends transactions to EVM smart contract in Frontend at any JS/TS dApp (web- or mobile-based, could be hosted in DStorage).

## SDK Modules

- address;
